active developers: jascotty2 & jjfs85
===============================================================================
In-Game Commands:
===============================================================================

Features:
===============================================================================

=== plugin support
currently dependent on 
- iConomy	http://forums.bukkit.org/threads/40/
--or
- BOSeconomy  	http://forums.bukkit.org/threads/4874/
Permissions support
Help support

=== configurable
Fully configurable colors and message text in config.yml file
shoplist can have text alignment (read config for more info): <item> <l(eft-aligned)> <buy and sell info>
- uses minecraft font character spacing, so is very close to perfectly aligned in chat
shoplist can optionally not show listing tail (or head, but recommended to leave <page> of <pages>)
Items can be colored in the new itemsdb.yml file
also in itemsdb.yml: kits!
- define your own kits that the shop can sell
- three examples provided, edit and add to your liking
Configurable Options:
-max pagesize when printing shoplist
-whether to broadcast all transactions publicly
-name of the pricelist file/table
-customsort: a custom sorting order, so you can have items at the top of the shop list
-allowbuyillegal: if someone without BetterShop.admin.illegal can buy illegal items
-whether maxstack should be honored
-if used tools can be bought back
-default color for items

=== shop flexibility
shopcheck will run a name comparison check, and return all matching items
Item sub-type support for dye colors, cloth colors, etc: magentacloth = 35:2 = cloth:magenta
"all" is a valid amount when buying or selling: "/sell cobblestone all" or "/sell all cobblestone"
damaged tools can be resold for an adjusted value of sellprice*(1-(damage/maxdamage))
buystack can be given multiple items, or number of stacks: "/buystack wool 5" or "/buystack wool blackdye reddye"
shopsellall can be given multiple items (/sell all cobble gravel flint dirt)
plural-insensitive items: if not found, will check if plural & remove "s"
not just items can be bought anymore: can now buy LivingEntities, like dogs (wolf)
signs can be used for buying & selling
- first line: [BetterShop] (not case-sensitive)
- second line: action: buy [amt], buyall, buystack, sell [amt], sellall, sellstack
- third line: item (name, id, etc)
- fourth line: unused (was going to make price, but decided on pricecheck instead)
- to activate, someone with BetterShop.admin.makesign must left-click the sign.. the first line will change color when active
- left-click for price check (or activate), right-click to buy/sell
- if a unauthorized player destroys a block a sign is on, is canceled

=== administration
Every item and subtype can be priced differently
Disable buying or selling of an item by giving it a price of -1	 (0 makes it free)
command aliases to stop carpal tunnel
many commands have sub-aliases.. eg. shoplist kits will run shoplistkits
MySQL pricelist support 
MySQL pricelist can be cached for a given timespan (decreases table selects) (flatfile is cached until manually updated)
Transaction records (MySQL or flatfile as .csv)
Downloads mysql-bin.jar dependency automatically
buy/sell cap in program set to 999,999,999 (not that you'd be using that much, but the cap is to prevent other errors)
if encounters errors while editing a player's account, will attempt to reload iConomy (i've had issuses with it before)
can backup the current pricelist: /shop backup
can restore from backup: /shop restore <file>
can import new prices in a batch from a csv (or old yml format) : /shop import <file>
on start, can check the download page to see if there is an update avaliable
shop can be given a finite stock from which to buy & sell
/shop ver[sion] to check the current version & see if there's an update
/shop update to manually download & install the most recent version
MinecraftIM support: forward errors or all messages
checks for missing & unused configuration nodes
strings have default values if missing
auto error reporting added (can be disabled)
custom message you can send with the error report
help main page integration can be disabled
global shop can be disabled & only allow signs to be used


There are two ways to add things to the shop:
Recommended, but slow: use /shopadd [item] [buy-price] [sell-price]
Faster: use a text editor (or spreadsheet program) to add items to the BetterShop.csv file. 
	items are in this order: id, subdata, buy, sell, name
	item id & subdata are checked against itemsdb.yml, and are removed if they don't exist
	for your convinence, you can use names (not subnames, though), so "wool,blue,1,-1" is a valid entry
	The name value is there only for human readability, it's not read by the plugin.

===============================================================================
Permissions:
===============================================================================
Just add the following nodes to Permissions' config.yml file (or data.yml file for GroupManager):

BetterShop.user.*	Allows the user to use the list, sell, buy, and help commands
BetterShop.admin.*	Allows the user to use the add, remove, and load commands

There are other nodes that allow only more specific permissions, but I recommend using the above.

BetterShop.user.list		look through shop listing of prices
BetterShop.user.check		check the price of item(s)
BetterShop.user.help		view ingame help menu
BetterShop.user.buy		buy items from the shop
BetterShop.user.sell		sell items to the shop
BetterShop.admin.add		add/edit items to/in the shop
BetterShop.admin.remove		remove items from the shop
BetterShop.admin.load		reload configuration & pricelist
BetterShop.admin.info		show shop stats (only version number right now)
BetterShop.admin.illegal	gives the ability to purchase 'illegal' items
BetterShop.admin.backup		backing up and restoring the pricelist
BetterShop.admin.restock	manually restock (if item stock is enabled)
BetterShop.admin.makesign	make/remove a bettershop sign

===============================================================================
TODO (items are removed as they're added)
===============================================================================

calculated/derived item prices
/shopvalue item[@amount] item  	to show the current trade value for two items
discount system: users or groups can be charged less/more for an item or all items (sell prices also affected)
dynamic market pricing, based off of logged market activity
region shops (items added while in a region defined as a shop are only added to that shop)
add option for amount in stock for surplus decreases how much item is worth to the shop
/shop alias <item> - show the itemname, with a list of aliases
add pages for /shopitems
more descriptive kit listing, similar to shoplist:
- pages
- show what makes up a kit
- enable admin.add to see avaliable kits
SQLite support?
tie item prices to stock quotes?
craftables' stock is tied to source material stock (if using sell craftables)
make LivingEntities follow the owner around?
make wolf already have player set as owner (waiting on bukkit to fix this..)
change buystock if itemStock is enabled so that if trying to buy multiple stacks (buystack item 20) and stock runs out to stop buying (stop showing "out of stock")
individually-customizable restock stock values per-item
chest shop interface ? 
automatically add missing config nodes (preserving comments)
add a simple builtin economy system, if none found?
add categories to items
- can search, buy, & sell with category
sign explosion protection ?
user-owned shops (signs, linked to chests)
4th line for configurable prices or shop profit owner




=== Removed (not going to implement)
persistentMySQL: if false, will disconnect from db when now using it (use if have a high cacheUpdate)
		(the MySQL connection is now shared with other features, so disonnecting could cause more performance issues)
dynamicDiscount: if a user has an applicable discount, will also discount items crafted using discount
		(if i do implement discounts, this will be automatic)
Cookies	integration:  http://forums.bukkit.org/threads/5327/
		(might implement if becomes active again)
items as currency (if no economy plugin)
		(as i began to write this, i realized that it's an entire economy plugin... one that i just might develop)

(older versions not shown..)

===============================================================================
Building
===============================================================================

To build, you need to include the following as libraries:
    bukkit.jar	(current build used git-Bukkit-0.0.0-516-gdf87bb3-b531jnks (MC: 1.3))
    iConomy.jar	(4.5.3)
    Permissions.jar 
    Help.jar	(0.2)

If you want helpful bukkit javadocs, you should get:
    the Bukkit source code

Once it builds, compress on linux using:
    jar or an equivalent archiver
      jenny:~/workspace/BetterShop/bin$ jar -cf BetterShop.jar *

or on Windows using:
    I have no clue. I guess something similar to jar.

And it's ready to be placed in a plugins directory :)
